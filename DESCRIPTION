Description: Training and predict functions for SLFN ( Single
        Hidden-layer Feedforward Neural Networks ) using the ELM
        algorithm. ELM algorithm differs from the traditional
        gradient-based algorithms for very short training times ( it
        doesn't need any iterative tuning, this makes learning time
        very fast ) and there is no need to set any other parameters
        like learning rate, momentum, epochs, etc.
